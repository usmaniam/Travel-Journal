# Travel journal

A travel journal built with ReactJS and styled with custom CSS based on a Figma design. There is no any interactivity in the project but it was enough in scope to help me wrap my head around React's concept of passing props which I was really strugging with.  

The project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Lessons Learned

- Design to code. I learned how to build a functional UI from scratch, from a Figma design.

- I cemented my knowledge of Flexbox and CSS. This is exactly why I chose to use custom CSS in the project instead of TailwindCSS which I had initially considered.
